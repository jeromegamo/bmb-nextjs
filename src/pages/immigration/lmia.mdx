For Canadian employers looking to hire foreign workers you may need to apply for an LMIA

## Need a LMIA?

For Canadian Employers who cannot find a local employee and need to hire a foreign worker, there may be need to apply for a Labour Market Impact Assessment. The Temporary Foreign Worker Program ([TFWP](https://www.immigratione.com/temporary-work-permits-canada)) allows employers hire temporary workers to fill temporary labor and skill shortages. Employers need a document from Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC)/Service Canada stating that they can hire a temporary worker, known as a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). An LMIA verifies that there is a need for a temporary worker and that no Canadians are available to do the job.

There are some key points to keep in mind when going to submit to LMIA; BMB Immigration and Recruitment will assist you every step of the way, form assessing your eligibility according to NOC codes, to assisting in hiring foreign workers and placement services.

## Requirements for LMIA 

-  The position that is being offered to the foreign worker was firstly made available to the Canadian worker, as it had been advertised for at least one month in three various sources; including online, newspaper and Job Bank;
-  Demonstrate in the LMIA that there a need for this foreign national to fill the occupation vacancy. Also, you would need to go and demonstrate that by hiring this foreign national, it is not going to have a negative impact on Canada’s labor market;
-  The next step would be the job offer from the employer and this would basically state that the position being offered is for full-time, permanent, paid work.
-  Once the LMIA is received the foreign worker can apply for their work permit and can use the job offer for their Express Entry application and gain extra points on their way to Permanent Residency.
