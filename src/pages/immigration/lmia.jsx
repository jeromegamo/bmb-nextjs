      <h1>Labour Market Impact Assessment</h1>
      <p>For Canadian employers looking to hire foreign workers you may need to apply for an LMIA</p>
      <h2>Need a LMIA?</h2>
      <p>For Canadian Employers who cannot find a local employee and need to hire a foreign worker, there may be need to apply for a Labour Market Impact Assessment. The Temporary Foreign Worker Program (<a href="https://www.immigratione.com/temporary-work-permits-canada">TFWP</a>) allows employers hire temporary workers to fill temporary labor and skill shortages. Employers need a document from Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC)/Service Canada stating that they can hire a temporary worker, known as a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). An LMIA verifies that there is a need for a temporary worker and that no Canadians are available to do the job.
