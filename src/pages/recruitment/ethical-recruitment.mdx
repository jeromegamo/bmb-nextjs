<title>Ethical Recruitment</title>

BMB International Recruitment is committed to providing the highest levels of service to both their employer partners and to the foreign workers placed. Key to this success is BMB’s commitment to ethical recruitment principles.

These principles ensure safe and sustainable pathways that have been proven to create long term success for BMB’s foreign workers and employers. Following BMB’s robust and transparent recruitment process, employers are assured that only the very best staff are selected for each position, speed and proficiency in processing visas / professional credentials, and our after arrival settlement care means workers can always reach out to their BMB contact for support on work related or personal matters.

BMB’s policy of no recruitment fees or related costs being paid by the worker ensures our employment partners are only hiring the best individual for the job based solely on merits, which in turn inspires loyalty to the employer and has been key to retaining talent for the long-term.

BMB are proud to operate in accordance with the Code of Practice for international recruitment of healthcare professionals.
