### A Message from the President

BMB International is a global organisation established in 1998, originally specializing in providing highly skilled health care professionals the opportunity to apply their talents to high end employers in the UK. BMB encompasses comprehensive services including Recruitment, Education and Immigration Consultancy service, with offices in the Philippines, UK and Canada. With an emphasis on quality service at every stage of the application process, BMB has maintained market leadership in ethical recruitment, education and immigration consultancy, while continuing to grow globally.

The pillars upon which BMB have been built are based upon the personal experiences of our founder, Brenda Briddon, who left the Philippines to study nursing in the United Kingdom. Following her graduation Brenda went on to establish a global network to fulfill care shortages for the UK.

With over 20 years experience and thousands of care staff placed globally, BMB International Recruitment’s innovative model based on long term holistic support has established BMB as a leader in sustainable placement services.

The personal investment with every individual was inspired by Brenda’s own experiences as an internationally educated nurse – providing BMB applicants, the support which she did not have.

This includes a family orientation before staff leave the country, accompaniment to the airport comprehensive support once the applicant lands in their new country.

BMB has now assisted over 4000 people to achieve their dreams and continues to maintain personal relations with individuals and their families.

BMB International Recruitment is committed to providing exemplary levels of service to their clients. The ethical standards as set out below form the framework for all business decision of the company.

Thank you for considering us and we look forward to serving you.
