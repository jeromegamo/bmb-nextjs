### **Living in Calgary**

Calgary is close to the world-famous Rocky Mountains and Banff National Park. It is home to over a million people and is the fourth largest city in Canada.

Calgary offers visitors activities all year. Enjoy the beautiful views while hiking, biking, or skiing. Or check out the cultural and artistic scene.

The city hosts many events, including the annual Calgary Stampede in July. Bow Valley College is in the heart of the city’s busy core.

Calgary shows one of the highest average wages of any other city in Canada. We’ve had the lowest average unemployment rate of major Canadian cities for the last 10 years. As a result, Bow Valley College students have found employment soon after graduation.

Calgary offers an opportunity to enjoy and experience all four seasons. The winters are cold. The summers are hot. Because of the dry climate, there are lots of sunny days and very few rainy ones. Additionally, the warm Chinook winds give us breaks from the cold during winter months.
